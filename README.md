# 7-Segment-Clock-PLUS
An astronomical based 7 segment digital clock I 3d printed and with the help of AI, programmed. This is to be run on the Arduino Mega with DS3231 RTC and RGB leds. The clock faces and diffusers are to be printed at 100% scale size so they fit inside the clock body (a scale version of my real life observatory- Dreamy Skies Observatory).
