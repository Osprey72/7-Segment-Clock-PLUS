# 7-Segment-Clock-PLUS
An astronomical based 7 segment digital clock I 3d printed and with the help of AI, programmed. This is to be run on the Arduino Mega with DS3231 RTC and RGB leds. The clock faces and diffusers are to be printed at 100% scale size so they fit inside the clock body (a scale version of my real life observatory- Dreamy Skies Observatory).
The scope of this project is to not only tell time but provide a scrolling marquee to see astronomical events happening for your area. The push button is to control the intensity or brightness of the clock. I am a light sleeper so a dimmer light is my preference. Maybe in a future edit, that can be automatically added into the code and the tactile button can become an on/off switch instead?
Maybe an LDR (light dependent resistor) can be added for an auto dimming feature during the day...or auto dimming for night? Just an idea :)
